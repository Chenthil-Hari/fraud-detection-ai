Project README ‚Äì AI for Real-Time Fraud & Social Engineering Detection
Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an AI-powered system that can analyze live text and audio conversations in real time to detect suspicious phrases, urgency cues, or fraudulent patterns. The system will provide alerts and warnings to financial institutions, customer support teams, and end-users to prevent financial fraud caused by social engineering attacks and scams.
